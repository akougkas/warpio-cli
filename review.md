# Warpio CLI - LM Studio Integration Issues

## Current Status
LM Studio models are detected when queried directly but not showing up in the model list. The core issue is that the health check for LM Studio is failing, preventing it from appearing in the providers list.

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Health Check Failing
- The `listAllProvidersModels` method in ModelDiscoveryService skips providers that fail health checks
- LM Studio adapter's `isServerRunning()` method is likely failing
- This prevents LM Studio from appearing in the main model list

### 2. Model Routing
- When using `lmstudio:model` syntax, the system still tries to use Gemini API
- The ClientFactory is not being invoked properly for LM Studio models
- The model discovery in `config.ts` doesn't find LM Studio models because they're filtered out

## Root Cause
The OpenAI-compatible adapter's health check is likely using the wrong endpoint or authentication. The health check endpoint should be `/v1/models` but the authentication header might be causing issues.

## Solutions Needed

1. **Fix Health Check**: 
   - Remove authentication header from health check
   - Ensure correct endpoint is used
   - Add better error logging

2. **Fix Model Discovery Filter**:
   - Don't filter out providers on health check failure for listing
   - Only filter for actual usage

3. **Fix Model Routing**:
   - Ensure LM Studio models are properly routed to LMStudioModelClient
   - Fix the cast to GeminiClient interface

## Test Results
- Direct query works: `discovery.listAvailableModels('lmstudio')` returns 8 models
- Health check fails: LM Studio not in `listAllProvidersModels()` results
- Models detected: qwen3-4b-instruct-2507@q8_0 with correct aliases
